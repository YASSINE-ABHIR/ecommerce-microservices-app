# E-commerce Microservices Application

This project is a modular E-Commerce application built using a microservices architecture. Each service is a standalone system implemented with Java (using Jakarta EE and Spring Data JPA) and managed independently. This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

## Project Overview

The **E-commerce Microservices Application** includes multiple services to manage different aspects of an e-commerce platform, such as:

- **Inventory Management**
- **Order Processing**
- **Gateway and API Routing**
- **Centralized Configuration**

### Key Features:

- Independent service deployment and scaling.
- Secure interactions between services.
- Swagger documentation for APIs.
- Feign clients for inter-service communication.

## Modules and Features

The project consists of the following modules:

### 1. **Config Service**

- Provides centralized configuration for all other microservices.

### 2. **Gateway Service**

- Acts as the API gateway, routing all external requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Handles security and authentication flows.

### 3. **Inventory Service**

- Manages the inventory of products.
- CRUD operations for product management.
- Secure access with role-based authorization and token validation.

### 4. **Order Service**

- Manages customer orders and order-related entities (e.g., product items within orders).
- Communicates with the Inventory Service using Feign clients for product availability checks.

## Technologies Used

The project incorporates the following tools and technologies:

- **Backend Frameworks:**

  - Java 22 with **Jakarta EE** and **Spring Data JPA**

- **Security:**

  - Keycloak for authentication.
  - JWT-based security.

- **Communication:**

  - Feign clients for inter-service calls.

- **API Management:**

  - Spring Web and REST Controllers.
  - Swagger for API documentation.

- **Microservices Infrastructure:**

  - Config Service for centralized configuration.
  - Gateway Service for unified routing.

- **Build Tools:**

  - Maven for dependency management and builds.

- **Database:**
  - Example: H2 as the in-memory database for local development.

## Getting Started

To start working with the E-commerce Microservices Application:

### Prerequisites:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK 22 or later).
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
3. Ensure **Keycloak** is running if using its authentication features.

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev7HD/e-com-Project_App
cd e-com-Project_App
```

### Build the Project:

Navigate into each service folder or the root where the `pom.xml` exists, then run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Configuration:

Ensure that all `application.properties` files (in each service) are properly configured for your environment, such as database, Keycloak, or other dependencies.

## Running the Application

### Start the Config Service:

Navigate to the `config-service` directory and start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Start the Gateway Service:

Navigate to the `gateway-service` directory and start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Start the Inventory Service:

Navigate to the `inventory-service` directory and start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Start the Order Service:

Navigate to the `order-service` directory and start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## APIs

### Swagger Documentation:

Swagger is enabled in multiple services. Once started, Swagger UI can be accessed:

- **Inventory Service Swagger:** `http://localhost:<port>/swagger-ui.html`
- **Order Service Swagger:** `http://localhost:<port>/swagger-ui.html`

### Sample Endpoints:

- Inventory Service:
  - `GET /api/products` - Get all products.
  - `POST /api/products` - Add a new product.
- Order Service:
  - `GET /api/orders` - Get all orders.
  - `POST /api/orders` - Place a new order.

### Authentication:

The services are secured using JWT tokens. You will need to obtain a valid token from Keycloak to access authenticated endpoints.
